### Thursday 11 May

Morning meeting - met with all the participants. Understood - more or less - what the current hardware and software does. 

Currently, there is:
* A Raspberry Pi 3, with software and a GUI that can scan the whole microscope table
* A custom motors board to control the motors
* An Arduino to control sensors and LEDs

Discussed what we would be working on: there was a multitude of proposals - sigh ... cf my notes for all of that

We finally did converge - I think? - to streaming the camera output to a web-page, and being able to control the microscope through a web-interface (hence not worrying anymore about the internal workings inside the Raspberry Pi).

And agreed to a further meeting on Saturday 3:30pm BST. Not sure what we will discuss there: we're expecting a demo of the current kit, and an introduction to the software? It would be helpful if we could finalise in broad terms what we will be working on.
